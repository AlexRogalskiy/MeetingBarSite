With a large number of meetings, it is very convenient to keep them in front of your eyes. I tried to use various applications from AppStore, but they were awkward and sometimes were completely abandoned.

So I wrote the application from scratch. It is free and completely open-source.

It helped me focus more on work, not miss my meetings, and to join them quickly. I hope that it will help you too.

You can leave your features request, look at others' requests, offer them on [Github](https://github.com/leits/MeetingBar/issues/new) or [email me directly](mailto:leits.dev@gmail.com?subject=MeetingBar), and be sure that the project will be supported and further developed.
