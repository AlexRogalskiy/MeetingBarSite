#### I try to install this app, but I have warnings from Apple and can't install/open

Apple isn't very friendly to software distributed outside of AppStore.
This app is fully opensource and doesn't have any security issue.
For installing it, you need to:

* Allow installing software outside of AppStore before installation
* Allow opening the app from Preferences after installation

Follow this official from Apple Support to do this:

* [Safely open apps on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491)

#### I don't use the macOS calendar but have Google Calendar/Outlook/any other calendar. How can I use this app?

Follow this simple apple guide to integrate your calendar to macOS calendar:

* [Add a calendar account](https://support.apple.com/guide/calendar/add-or-delete-calendar-accounts-icl4308d6701/mac) from Apple Support Guides

#### The application takes a long time to update calendar changes

The application is updated immediately after changes to the macOS calendar app.
By default, the calendar app update subscribed calendars only every 15 minutes.
But you can reduce it manually:

* [Refresh calendars on Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/calendar/icl1024/mac) from Apple Support Guides

#### Will there be an app for Windows?

No. The application based on the macOS Calendar API, which is not compatible with the Windows calendar.
