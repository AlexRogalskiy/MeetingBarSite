<h2>I try to install this app, but I have warnings from Apple and can't install/open</h2>

Apple isn't very friendly to software distributed outside of AppStore.
This app is fully opensource and doesn't have any security issue.
For installing it, you need to:

* Allow installing software outside of AppStore before installation
* Allow opening the app from Preferences after installation

Follow this official from Apple Support to do this:

<h2>The application takes a long time to update calendar changes</h2>

The application is updated immediately after changes to the macOS calendar app.
By default, the calendar app update subscribed calendars only every 15 minutes.
But you can reduce it manually:

<h2>Will there be an app for Windows?</h2>

No. The application based on the macOS Calendar API, which is not compatible with the Windows calendar.
